# PixlJournal
A minimal, lightweight, file-based journaling website built with [my own PHP framework](https://github.com/pixlmint/Nacho) and Vue

## Backstory
In 2018, I had a little blog during my 3 Weeks in Paris where I documented my time there.
Looking back at that I get very sentimental and I figured, since I'm not someone to have a book journal, I would much rather do something like that with my own Website.
